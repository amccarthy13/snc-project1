Code acts as a server and a client depending on which arguments are given.  server can accept multiple connections at once.
if Ctrl+D is pressed when using TCP, client and server instances are killed.
If Ctrl+D is pressed when using UDP only sending over the socket is stopped.
Client can accept messages infinitely until a kill command is given and server can recieve commands until a kill command is given.

To compile, run make.  run the binary snc with appropriate arguments to execute the program.
First, enter a message and hit enter to send it.  If the message was recieved correctly,
client should display "I got your message".  However, this does not happen with UDP,
you will need to check that the server received the message to confirm.
Server will display "Here is the message: <message>" as messages are recieved.  enter Ctrl+D to stop the program.

the program will fail if non-accepted flags if too many or too little arguments are given, and if the port number or ip address is incorrect.
